# REST API for User with Nodejs, MongoDB and Expressjs

### In this Back-End API we develop all the routes for User like:

Create a user with unique email address and hash password, Read all users or a single user, 
update and delete user, along with a signin route that verify, first, the email in the DB and check if the password is correct; otherwise you'll
not be able to log. We could enhance the  features. But we Keep it like this for now. 

We used Postman to test our Routes API, feel free to use it too.
